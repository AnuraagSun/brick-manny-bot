I understand you want me to create a more sophisticated prompt that focuses on using advanced libraries to build an efficient video editing bot. Here's a revised prompt specifically for me to create the bot:

# Advanced Video Editing Bot: Automated Ball Impact Meme Generator

Create a high-performance video editing bot that replicates the effect seen in the sheep meme video, but for a Breakout-style game. The bot should seamlessly insert GenZ meme clips whenever a ball hits blocks, with the meme continuing to play during chain reactions until all blocks are destroyed.

## Implementation Requirements:
- Use MoviePy and PySceneDetect for efficient video manipulation and scene detection
- Implement OpenCV with CUDA acceleration for real-time collision detection
- Utilize Tensorflow or PyTorch models pre-trained for object tracking to identify balls and blocks
- Leverage FFmpeg with hardware acceleration for final rendering
- Use multiprocessing to parallelize video analysis and generation

## Technical Specifications:
1. **Collision Detection System**:
   - Apply pre-trained CNN models to track game objects across frames
   - Implement motion vector analysis for precise impact detection
   - Use optical flow algorithms to handle multiple simultaneous collisions

2. **Video Composition**:
   - Use GPU-accelerated compositing for real-time layering
   - Implement frame-accurate synchronization between game footage and meme clips
   - Utilize dynamic memory management to handle large video files efficiently

3. **Effect Pipeline**:
   - Create parameterized effect intensities based on collision count
   - Implement shader-based visual effects (shake, zoom, color shifts)
   - Use dynamic audio mixing for impact sound augmentation

4. **User Configuration**:
   - JSON-based configuration file for all parameters
   - Preset system for different meme styles and intensities
   - Preview rendering at lower resolution for quick iteration

## Development Approach:
- Containerize the application with Docker for consistent environment
- Implement a simple web UI with Flask or FastAPI for configuration
- Create batch processing capability for multiple videos
- Add progress reporting through WebSocket for long processing jobs

The goal is to create a solution that processes videos in near real-time by leveraging GPU acceleration and optimized algorithms, eliminating the need for manual video editing while maintaining high-quality output that matches the viral GenZ aesthetic of the reference video.
