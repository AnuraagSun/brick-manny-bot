Prompt for Building a Video Editing Automation Bot
Objective:

Design a bot that automates the video editing process of adding a specific "genz vibey meme" video clip at precise moments within a longer video, based on the occurrence of a visual event (ball hitting blocks).

Detailed Description:

The bot should be able to:

Input:

Receive two video files:

Primary Video: The video containing the ball and blocks/bricks.

Meme Video: The short "genz vibey meme" video clip.

Receive parameters:

Timing accuracy: Define how precisely the meme video should sync with the ball-block collision. (e.g., within 10ms, 50ms, etc.)

Meme video duration: The exact length of the meme video clip.

Volume levels: Control the audio volume of both the primary video and the meme video during playback.

Scaling/Position: Define the size and position of the meme video overlay on the primary video.

Transition effect: Specify how the meme video appears and disappears (e.g., fade-in, fade-out, cut).

Process:

Analyze Primary Video:

Use computer vision techniques to detect the precise moment(s) when the ball collides with a block/brick.

Accurately record the timestamps of each collision.

Handle scenarios where the ball hits multiple blocks simultaneously or in very quick succession.

Overlay Meme Video:

For the first instance of the ball hitting the block: Overlay the meme video from the start, for the duration of the meme video.

For subsequent instances where the ball hits blocks continuously until all blocks are destroyed: Play the meme video concurrently with the primary video, starting from the moment of each impact and playing for the duration of the meme video. This creates a sustained meme overlay effect for the entire duration of continuous block hits.

Synchronize the meme video playback with the recorded collision timestamps, ensuring minimal delay.

Apply the specified scaling, positioning, and transition effects to the meme video overlay.

Adjust audio levels as specified, potentially lowering the primary video's audio and raising the meme video's audio for emphasis.

Output:

Generate a new video file that incorporates the meme video overlays at the detected collision points.

Maintain the original resolution and frame rate of the primary video, unless otherwise specified.

Provide options for different output video formats (e.g., MP4, AVI).

Key Considerations:

Accuracy: The bot's accuracy in detecting ball-block collisions and synchronizing the meme video is crucial.

Speed: The bot should process videos efficiently, minimizing the time required for analysis and editing.

Robustness: The bot should be able to handle variations in video quality, lighting conditions, and block/ball appearance.

Flexibility: The bot should provide adjustable parameters to customize the editing process, such as meme video duration, scaling, positioning, volume, and transition effects.

User Interface: (If applicable) A user-friendly interface would be beneficial for ease of use, allowing users to input video files, set parameters, and monitor the editing process.  This could be a simple command-line interface or a more advanced graphical user interface.

Error Handling: The bot should include error handling to gracefully manage situations such as invalid input files, unexpected video formats, or processing errors.  It should provide informative error messages to the user.

Scalability: Consider the potential for batch processing of multiple videos.

Genz Vibe Preservation: The bot should ensure the meme video is played in its entirety and at the correct speed to preserve its intended "genz vibe".

Technical Requirements:

Programming Language: (Python is recommended due to its extensive libraries for video processing and computer vision)

Libraries:

OpenCV: For video analysis and object detection.

FFmpeg: For video editing, manipulation, and format conversion.

MoviePy (if using Python): A video editing library that simplifies many FFmpeg operations.

Potentially, a machine learning library (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) could be used for more advanced ball-block collision detection, if needed for accuracy.

Computer Vision Techniques:

Object detection or motion tracking to identify the ball.

Edge detection or shape analysis to identify the blocks.

Frame differencing or optical flow to detect the moment of impact.

Example Workflow:

The user provides the primary video and the meme video to the bot.

The user sets the desired parameters (timing accuracy, meme video duration, scaling, etc.).

The bot analyzes the primary video frame by frame, detecting ball-block collisions and recording the timestamps.

The bot overlays the meme video onto the primary video at each collision timestamp, applying the specified parameters.

The bot generates the final edited video and saves it to a file.
